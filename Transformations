Transpose an array A:
-- In host code
 + Change argument for the dimension.
 + Create a A_transposed variable
 + Code for transposing A into A_transposed

-- In device code
 + Change the subscript in A to match the transposed data in A_transposed

-- Must run transpose before generating any boilerplate code, otherwise we need to make changes to the generated AST, which is more troublesome.

First step try to swap array name at the correct places
 + only in AllocateBuffers?

First step try to swap dimension at the correct places
 + only in SetArguments?
