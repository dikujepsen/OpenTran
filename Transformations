Transpose an array A:
-- In device code
 + Change the subscript in A to match the transposed data in A_transposed -> In the AST, but check that it is correct, i.e. that we have 2-dimed subscripts in the AST.

-- Must run transpose before generating any boilerplate code, otherwise we need to make changes to the generated AST, which is more troublesome.

First step try to swap array name at the correct places
 + only in AllocateBuffers?

First step try to swap dimension at the correct places
 + only in SetArguments?

-- hold certain Dicts for each Function. Share where necessary.

# DONE
-- One Dict KernelArg for SetArguments  
-- In host code
 + Change argument for the dimension. -> In SetArguments dict
 + Code for transposing A into A_transposed -> In the transposition AST
 + Create a A_transposed variable     -> In hstptrs dict, in the global addr space
 + Done by Adding GlobalVars dict
